## 🧹 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before analysis, your data must be **clean, accurate, and structured**:

- **Remove Duplicates** – Eliminate redundant records
- **Find & Replace** – Fix recurring typos or inconsistencies
- **Data Validation** – Prevents incorrect inputs (e.g., dropdowns)
- **Flash Fill** – Auto-fills values based on patterns
- **Power Query** – Automates complex data cleaning and transformations

## 🧱 3. Structuring Data for Analysis

Make your data more usable by organizing it well:

- **Excel Tables** – Turn raw ranges into structured datasets
- **Slicers** – Add interactive filters to tables and Pivot Tables
- **Pivot Tables** – Summarize, group, and analyze large datasets
- **Power Pivot & Data Modeling** – Work with **relationships** across multiple tables

## 📈 4. Visualizing Data with Charts

Visualization helps uncover patterns, trends, and insights:

| Chart Type         | Use Case                                                 |

| **Line**           | Show trends over time                                    |
| **Pie / Donut**    | Show proportions (use sparingly)                         |
| **Scatter Plot**   | Explore relationships between two numeric variables      |
| **Heat Map**       | Highlight data intensities across cells                  |
| **Histogram**      | Analyze frequency distributions                          |

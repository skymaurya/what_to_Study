# Data Analysis Roadmap

A complete step-by-step journey from beginner to job-ready data analyst.

---

## 1. Mathematics & Statistics Fundamentals

### Why It Matters
You need these to understand trends, outliers, probability, and the story behind your data.  
Without this, even advanced dashboards or ML models won’t make sense.

### What to Learn
- Descriptive Statistics: Mean, Median, Mode, Range, Variance, Standard Deviation  
- Probability Basics: Independent & dependent events, permutations, combinations  
- Distributions: Normal, Binomial, Poisson  
- Hypothesis Testing: Null vs Alternate, p-value, confidence intervals  
- Correlation & Regression: Simple & multiple linear regression

## 2. Excel

### Why It Matters
Excel builds your data problem-solving mindset — perfect for non-programmers before jumping to code.  
It helps you think in terms of data cleaning, visualization, and logic building.

### What to Learn
- Data Cleaning & Formatting  
- Pivot Tables, Filters, Conditional Formatting  
- Formulas: VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, IF, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS  
- Charts & Dashboards  
- Simple Regression using Excel Data Analysis Toolpak

## 3. SQL (Structured Query Language)

### Why It Matters
SQL is the language of data.  
Every analyst uses it daily to pull, join, and transform data from databases.

### What to Learn (80/20 Focus)
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING  
- JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)  
- Subqueries & CTEs  
- Aggregate Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)  
- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD)  
- CASE WHEN & Conditional Logic  

### Resources
- YouTube Channel: [TechTFQ](https://www.youtube.com/@techTFQ/videos) (best free SQL course)  
- LeetSQL (practice problems)

## 4. Data Visualization Tools

### Why It Matters
You need to communicate insights visually.  
Learning one visualization tool deeply is enough to showcase in your portfolio.

### What to Learn
Choose one:  
- Power BI (Microsoft Ecosystem)  
- Tableau (More visual flexibility)  

Then learn:
- Importing and Cleaning Data  
- Creating Bar, Line, Pie, Map, and KPI charts  
- Calculated Fields and Parameters  
- Dashboard Design & Storytelling  
- Publishing and Sharing Reports  

### Resources

## 5. Python for Data Analysis

### Why It Matters
Python is the bridge between data analysis and automation / AI.  
You’ll use it for analysis, scripting, and even automating dashboards.

### What to Learn
- Python Basics: Variables, Loops, Functions, Lists, Dictionaries  
- Libraries for Data Analysis:
  - pandas – data manipulation  
  - numpy – numerical analysis  
  - matplotlib, seaborn, plotly – visualization  
- Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Working with CSV/Excel/SQL data  
- Introduction to APIs & Web Scraping

## 6. Presentation & Communication Skills

### Why It Matters
You’ll often present to non-technical stakeholders.  
This step helps you bridge the gap between data and decision-making.

### What to Improve
- Storytelling with Data (setup → insight → impact)  
- Slide & Dashboard Design Principles  
- Explaining technical concepts simply  
- Report writing and summarization 

---

## 7. Resume, Portfolio & Projects

### Why It Matters
Recruiters don’t hire learners — they hire problem solvers.  
Your portfolio proves that you can do real-world analysis.

### What to Include
- Projects using real data (Kaggle, Google Dataset Search)  
- Power BI or Tableau dashboards (published online)  
- Python notebooks (GitHub or Google Colab)  
- Case studies written like business problems  
- Resume tailored to Data Analyst roles  
- LinkedIn + GitHub portfolio synced
